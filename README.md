# JPEG-Pytorch
A pytorch implementation of JPEG compression. 
This is a modified version of DiffJPEG (https://github.com/mlomnitz/DiffJPEG).

## What have I changed
I just make the quality adjustment more flexible, and slim the code without modifying the algorithm :-)

The round operation is also changed, to make it accurate.
